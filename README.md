# NILMTK_models
#### Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) is the process of estimating the energy consumed by individual appliances given just a whole-house power meter reading. In other words, it produces an (estimated) itemised energy bill from just a single, whole-house power meter.

### What is NILMTK? (https://github.com/nilmtk/nilmtk)
NILMTK is a toolkit designed to help researchers evaluate the accuracy of NILM algorithms. 

This repository contains two models, one utilises self-attention mechanism, and the other builds on it by adding positional encoding
Both these models were able to drastically outperform the benchmark aglorithms provided in NILMTK for comparative purposes.
